## Strategy:

## 1. Read in detection tables from R
##  a. These could be the tables from the field, created from inputting one PAM and getting detections matching on others.
##  b. Alternatively they could come from Raven. Just put them through your R selection to get them into the same format with the additional R columns.
## 2. Split the table into individual gorillas, by the "Approx Order" column you made, assuming no two gorillas are closest to the same PAM (focus on within grid...).
##  a. Optionally, before splitting them add a buffer to the start of each unique-CB ('buff')
## 3. Loop the above through each gorilla's detections data table.
##  a. Choose a key PAM. Currently it's based on the selected individual IDs, but you will do this using Approx Order to automate it.
##  b. Glue together all the detections from that individual on the key PAM together (set "len" for the unique-CB length).
##  c. Record the time gaps between each unique-CB from that PAM.
##  d. Then loop through the remaining PAMs (actually all even the key PAM, so as to check the gaps didn't get messed):
##    i. Using the first detection on the specific PAM as a base and the time gaps from the key PAM, glue together the same time fragments for each PAM
##   ii. Save as a list to use in the next step (cross-correlation). Print the spectrograms to verify no errors.

## Alternatively could incorporate selection of delay into the function manually instead of wide length, but need to paste in emptiness and gets complicated
